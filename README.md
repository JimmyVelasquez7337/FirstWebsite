# FirstWebsiteProject

This website portfolio was created using Angular to showcase my skills effectively through its structured use of Angular components, HTML, CSS, and TypeScript for navigation. The portfolio is built around Angular's component-based architecture, where each component encapsulates a specific part of the website's functionality. HTML files define the structure and content of each component, while CSS files style them, ensuring a cohesive and visually appealing presentation. Page navigation is implemented using TypeScript, leveraging Angular's routing capabilities. This allows seamless transitions between different sections or pages of my portfolio, enhancing user experience and accessibility. This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
